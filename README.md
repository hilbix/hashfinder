# Hashfinder

Hashfinder is:

- A distributed `git`-based database to register file hashes
- A way to locate the origin of a hash value with this database
- A tool to verify a file based on the file's hash value
- A way to authenticate such a file
- A platform with an API to conveniently access this
- A DNS based lookup service for hashes

## Usage

T.B.D.


## Platform

The Hashfinder platform consists of following parts:

- [Database](DATABASE.md)
- [Webservice](https://hashfinder.org/)
- DNS (T.B.D)
- Tools (this here)
- [CI-Scripts](.cirrus.yml)
- Cloud service (mostly driven by CI)

It uses trainloads of other tools like OpenSSL or GnuPG.
